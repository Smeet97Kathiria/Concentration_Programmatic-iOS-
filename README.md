# Concentration_Programmatic-iOS-
This is my version of the iOS concentration game taught in stanfords CS193 course.. This project shows the implementation of the UI programmatically. The UI also supports layouts of all screen sizes. Stack views, size classes, trait collections was used to implement autolayout functionality by code.
